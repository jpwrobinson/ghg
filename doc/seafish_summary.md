We are designing a research project that investigates trade-offs between nutritional value, fisheries sustainability, and GHG emissions in the UK seafood sector. Fish and invertebrates are a source of essential dietary nutrients (minerals and vitamins), and many seafood products have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than most animal-source foods. This suggests seafood can contribute to sustainable, healthy diets. Yet nutrient concentrations vary between species, and GHG emissions can vary between fishing sectors (e.g. trawl or pelagic, domestic or international, wild or farmed). The first objective of our project is to identify seafood products that are both nutritious and low GHG emitters. 

In the UK, fishing and aquaculture sectors produce and export a huge diversity of species, from wild pelagic and demersal fishes to farmed salmon and mussels. Many more species are imported, such as tuna. The second objective is to identify which seafood products offer most potential to contribute to sustainable, low-carbon diets in the UK, given current production volumes and trade flows.

At Lancaster University, we have compiled an extensive database on fish and shellfish nutrient quality (Hicks et al. 2019 Nature). Seafish and collaborators at Dalhousie University (Robert Parker, Peter Tyedmers) developed a carbon calculator to estimate GHG of species and fisheries. The next steps are:

1) Identify the top 20 seafood products available for UK consumption ( = (landings + aquaculture + imports) - exports)

2) Collate production volumes and import/export information on these 20 products.

These data would provide species list for the nutrient & GHG emission datasets, and production volumes would be used to develop plausible future scenarios of nutritious, sustainable seafood sectors (e.g. growth in shellfish aquaculture, promoting domestic pelagic fisheries).

Seafish are perfectly placed to help us collate these production/trade datasets, and provide expertise on UK seafood. We would publish this project in a high-profile journal, promote findings in news media, and make the datasets and scenarios freely available to other researchers, policymakers etc.

I hope you're interested - happy to continue chatting and dig into these ideas further.
