We are interested in trade-offs between nutritional value, fisheries  sustainability, and GHG emissions in the UK seafood sector. Fish and  invertebrates are a source of essential dietary nutrients (minerals and  vitamins), and many seafood products have lower greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions than most animal-source foods. This suggests seafood can  contribute to sustainable, healthy diets. Yet nutrient concentrations  vary between species, and GHG emissions can vary between fishing sectors (e.g. trawl or pelagic, domestic or international, wild or farmed). **The first objective of our project is to identify seafood products that are both nutritious and low GHG emitters.** 

In the UK, fishing and aquaculture sectors produce and export a huge 	diversity of species, from wild pelagic and demersal fishes to farmed salmon and mussels. Many more species are imported, such as tuna. **The second objective is to identify which seafood products offer most  potential to contribute to sustainable, low-carbon diets in the UK,  given current production volumes and trade flows.**
